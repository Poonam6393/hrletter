
HOW TO KILL THE PROCESS -

1) netstat -ao | find "8080"
2) Taskkill /PID  20712 /F

DELETE THE BRANCH -

push latest code -
	git status
	git add .
	git commit -m 'added files'
	git push origin bugfix/STOX/Settings/LOGBUS-29372
	git checkout develop
	git pull

Squash the commits -
		1) git rebase -i HEAD~<no of commits>
		2) another window will open with all commit deatails (eg, pick, squash, delete etc), so we can do according to our requirement 
		3) e.g. here we need to combine 5 commits in a single one 
		4) latest one will be pick and other 4 will be squash or s
		5)  esc -> :wq -> enter
		6) another window will open to edit the our committed message (to delete single line go to that line and press only 0'dd'
                                                                            to delete multiple line press number of lines'dd')
																			
		7) you will get into our parent git bash window with message (sucess or failed etc).
		8) git push origin bugfix/STOX/DealerMaster/LOGBUS-28663 --force-with-lease
